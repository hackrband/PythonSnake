# PythonSnake

A retro-style Snake game written in Python with classic gameplay and built-in score tracking.

## Overview

This project brings back the nostalgia of the classic Snake game with:

- Retro-inspired visuals (see `retro-snake-logo.ico`)
- Multiple script variants (`main copy.py`, `secondary copy.py`, `skeleton copy.py`, etc.) for experimentation or feature expansion
- Score tracking mechanisms to keep you challenged

*(Note: The `data copy.txt` file may store high scores, game states, or other persistent dataâ€”check its content for details.)*
