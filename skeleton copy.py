# Snake.io Game Plans:

# 1. Initialize game environment:
#    - Set up the game window.
#    - Create the snake with initial length and position.
#    - Generate the first food item.

# 2. Main game loop:
#    - Continuously update the game state until the game ends.
#    - Check for user input (direction changes) and update snake movement accordingly.
#    - Check for collisions:
#        - If the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries, end the game.
#        - If the snake eats food, increase its length and generate a new food item.
#    - Update the display to reflect the current game state.

# 3. Handle user input:
#    - Listen for user key presses to change the direction of the snake.
#    - Map key presses to direction changes (e.g., arrow keys for up, down, left, right).

# 4. Update snake movement:
#    - Move the snake one step in the current direction.
#    - Ensure the snake's movement is smooth and continuous.
#    - Allow the snake to wrap around the game boundaries (teleporting to the opposite side).

# 5. Check for collisions:
#    - Detect collisions between the snake's head and its body segments.
#    - Detect collisions between the snake and the game boundaries.
#    - Detect collisions between the snake and food items.

# 6. Handle collisions:
#    - If the snake collides with itself or the boundaries, end the game.
#    - If the snake eats food, increase its length and update the score.
#    - Generate a new food item in a random location on the game grid.

# 7. Update game display:
#    - Render the snake and food items on the game window.
#    - Update the score display.
#    - Display any additional game information (e.g., high score).

# 8. Game over:
#    - Display a game over message.
#    - Allow the player to restart the game or exit.
